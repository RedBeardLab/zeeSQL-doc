# Why the name changed

zeeSQL was formerly known as RediSQL.

As a name, RediSQL, puts together both Redis and SQL, a perfect match for the product.

Unfortunately `RediSQL` might be an infringement of the `Redis` trademark.
The names are remarkably similar indeed.

When the project started the `Redis` trademark was hold by Salvatore Sanfilippo, aka antirez, the creator of Redis.
No problems about the name were ever raised by him.

Today, the `Redis` trademark is held by `Redis Lab` the company behind the development and commercialization of Redis itself.

No pressure whatsoever was ever been applied to `RediSQL` nor to us to change the name in something different.

Nevertheless, a commercial company has objectives and resources different from the one of a single developer.

Hence, we decided to avoid any possible issues with the trademark, and proactively change the name from `RediSQL` to `zeeSQL`.
