In-memory databases are generally a little faster but they are limited by the amount of memory your server has. Database backed by files are a little slower but they can grow basically indefinitely.\n\n\nExec\n\n\nZEESQL.EXEC\n is the command that let you execute command against a SQL database.\n\n\nIt is useful when you are testing the module or when you are changing the settings of the databases through SQLite \nPRAGMA\ns.\n\n\nHowever, I would not suggest to use them in production since there are better tools like \nStatements\n.\n\n\nStatements\n\n\nQueries and statements can be precompiled and stores inside the Redis key in order to provide a faster execution and more agility in your application.\n\n\nWhen you execute an SQLite query, the text is compiled to a binary code, this binary code is then executed against the database and the result provide an answer.\nThe phase of compilation can be quite expensive, but if you always execute the same statements (think about \ninserts\n), it can be avoided.\n\n\nWhen you use \nZEESQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\n your statement is compiled, then when you execute it using \nZEESQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n it is not re-compiled but we use the pre-compiled one. It seems a trivial change but it will really speed up some workload.\n\n\nStatements can also be used as an interface for different applications using the same RediSQL instance.\n\n\nOnce you define the interface of the statement and its behaviour, then you are free to change it's implementation while maintaining all the legacy code working.\nThis is quite useful especially if you have several services using the same RediSQL instance.\n\n\nQuery\n\n\nIn most databases there are statements that modify the data and queries that simply read.\n\n\nOf course, just reading, is usually a faster and simpler operation than modify the data. In order to take advantages of this, we provide a different command \nZEESQL.QUERY\n and \nZEESQL.QUERY_STATEMENT\n that constraint you to don't modify the data.\n\n\nThese commands allow you to have slaves/replicas serves query and to balance some load off the master node for better speed and reliability.\n\n\nPersistency\n\n\nThe module in the community version implements only RDB. However, the PRO version provides also AOF and replication.\n\n\nRDB\n\n\nThe module implements RDB persistency.\n\n\nWhen Redis starts to save the RDB file the status of the database get serialized and written, along with all the other information, in the RDB file.\n\n\nAOF\n\n\nAOF replication is provided only in the PRO edition.\n\n\nAll the commands are replicated, but the read-only ones.\n\n\nWith AOF replication you also get instance replication that allows replicating the same dataset into different Redis instances in a master/slave fashion.\n\n\nObtain\n\n\nThere are \ntwo version\n of the software, a \"community\", completely open source version and a PRO version that comes with \nmore features and support plan.\n\n\nBoth versions can be \nobtained in the store.\n\n\nFor the community version, you can just download it, we ask for a small donation if you can support the project but feel free to just input 0\u20ac and download it.\n\n\nFor the PRO version you need to \nsign up here\n, after you signed up you will be able to download the software.\n\n\nA detailed coverage of the PRO version \nis provided here\n\n\nFinally you can also obtain the software from \ngithub releases\n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nThe main motivation behind the project is to provide a quick and hands-off environment to store structured data.\n\n\nIt also turns out that RediSQL is a great way to cache your content and data in a more structured way.\n\n\nThe main history and motivation of the project are explained \nin this page.\n\n\nNot open source\n\n\nRediSQL V1 was an open source project, that provided all the source code on github.\n\n\nUnfortunately the project was not suistanable, users were not paying.\n\n\nIn order to provide useful code, it is necessary continuos work and improvements, without a stream of money this is impossible.\n\n\nmiaoSQL\n, provides extra features on top of the one in RediSQL, and we believe that people benefits from it, should help support the product.\n\n\nmiaoSQL\n provides a free options, powerful enough for a lot of use cases.\n\n\nPRO\n\n\nThe PRO edition is based on the Open Source one, however, it provides one more class of commands that are necessary for business or where rediSQL is a critical piece of the infrastructure.\n\n\nEvery command, but \nZEESQL.CREATE_DB\n, blocks the clients and it is executed in the background by a different thread.\n\n\nWith the PRO version, we also provide the \n.NOW\n commands that are executed immediately without blocking the client.\n\n\nEvery command in the PRO version provides the \n.NOW\n variant, but please refer to the \nreference\n.\n\n\nMoreover, the PRO version also provides AOF replication, that, indeed, necessitate of commands that don't block the clients.\n\n\nMore information about the PRO version are available \nhere.",

Also note that we clean up the machine every hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your database\n\n\nThe first fundamental concept in zeeSQL is the concept of database.\n\n\nOne database is a SQLite database that is associated with a Redis key, creating a new database also means to spawn a new thread that will be the one that actually does the work leaving the main Redis thread available to answer standard Redis queries.\n\n\nTo create a new zeeSQL database just run:\n\n\nREDISQL.CREATE_DB TUTORIAL\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new in-memory database associated with the name \nTUTORIAL\n.\n\n\n(If you receive an error at this stage, most likely someone else is following the tutorial, no worries, instead of \nTUTORIAL\n simply use another name).\n\n\nFirst interaction\n\n\nNow that we have create a new database, we can interact with it.\n\n\nThe simplest command to use is the \nREDISQL.EXEC\n command that will execute one query against our newly created database, try:\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC TUTORIAL \"SELECT 1;\"\n\n1) 1) (integer) 1\n\n\n\n\nThis command should simply return 1.\n\n\nWhat we can do, is to create a simple SQL table.\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC TUTORIAL \"CREATE TABLE first_table(a integer, b string);\"\n\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 0\n\n\n\n\nCongrats, you have just created a new table.\n\n\nInsert values\n\n\nAfter we create our first table, we can insert some value into it.\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC TUTORIAL \"INSERT INTO first_table VALUES(1, 'the first row'), (2, 'the second row');\"\n\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 2\n\n\n\n\nThis command will return 2, the number of rows inserted.\n\n\nQuery values\n\n\nNow we can try to select some values from our table, as an example:\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC TUTORIAL \"SELECT * FROM first_table;\"\n\n1) 1) (integer) 1\n   2) \"the first row\"\n2) 1) (integer) 2\n   2) \"the second row\"\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to select values is to use the \nQUERY\n command, this command works only if the query you send is a read-only query.\n\n\nREDISQL.QUERY TUTORIAL \"SELECT * FROM first_table WHERE a = 1;\"\n\n1) 1) (integer) 1\n   2) \"the first row\"\n\n\n\n\nStatements\n\n\nWriting this commands all over again get tedious, moreover, it is inefficient since the SQL engine needs to parse and compile the SQL query every time. The solution, in this case, is the use of statements.\n\n\nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT TUTORIAL filter_on_a \"SELECT * FROM first_table WHERE a = ?1;\"\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\nThe statements can both query (as above) or insert rows:\n\n\nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT TUTORIAL new_row \"INSERT INTO first_table VALUES(?1, 'insert_from_statement');\"\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\nStatements can be invoked using:\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT TUTORIAL new_row 5\n\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 1\n\n\n\n\nOr if they are read-only statements:\n\n\nREDISQL.QUERY_STATEMENT TUTORIAL filter_on_a 5\n\n1) 1) (integer) 5\n   2) \"insert_from_statement\"\n\n\n\n\nPush to streams\n\n\nSometimes you may want to store the result of your queries in Redis itself, to consume it little by little, or for caching. In such cases, the solution is to push the results into a Redis stream.\n\n\nREDISQL.QUERY.INTO tutorial_stream TUTORIAL \"SELECT * FROM first_table;\"\n\n1) 1) \"tutorial_stream\"\n   2) \"1569174107783-0\"\n   3) \"1569174107783-2\"\n   4) (integer) 3\n\n\n\n\nThis will push the result of the query into the stream \ntutorial_stream\n and it will return:\n1. The name of the stream\n2. The first ID\n3. The last ID\n4. The total number of elements added\n\n\nIn order to retrieve the values from the Redis stream, you can use the standard Redis API:\n\n\nXRANGE tutorial_stream - +\n\n1) 1) \"1569174107783-0\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"1\"\n      3) \"text:b\"\n      4) \"the first row\"\n2) 1) \"1569174107783-1\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"2\"\n      3) \"text:b\"\n      4) \"the second row\"\n3) 1) \"1569174107783-2\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"5\"\n      3) \"text:b\"\n      4) \"insert_from_statement\"\n\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\nI hope that this tutorial was helpful :)\n\n\nIf you have any question, feel free to contact me simone@redbeardlab.com or on github: \nRedBeardLab/rediSQL",

Then it stores the information regarding the statement in the metadata table in order to provide a simple way to restore also the statements.\n\n\nThe statement is associated with a database, a statement created for one database cannot be used for another database, you need to create a different one. This allows a simple and fast way to provide persistence.\n\n\nYou can execute the statement with \nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n.\n\n\nYou cannot overwrite a statement using this command.\n\n\nIf you need to change the implementation of a statement you have two options:\n\n\n\n\nDelete the statement using \nREDISQL.DELETE_STATEMENT\n and the create a new one.\n\n\nUse \nREDISQL.UPDATE_STATEMENT\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a service needs a particular statement to be defined in order to work, this safety measure allows the users to simply go ahead, try to create it, and in case catch the error.\n\n\nAlso, this command is not blocking, meaning that all the work happens in a separate thread respect the redis one.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that the parameters should be named in order and that there should not be any gap.\n\n\nINSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3); -- this one is fine and we work as you expect\n\nINSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?123, ?564); -- this one will be more problematic, and you should avoid it\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that SQLite start to count the bounding parameters from 1 and not from 0, using \n?0\n is an error.\n\n\nComplexity\n: If we assume that the time necessary to compile a string into a sqlite statement is constant, overall the complexity is O(1), again constant, not necessarily \nfast\n.\n\n\nSee also\n:\n\n\n\n\nSQLite \nsqlite3_prepare_v2\n\n\nSQLite \nstatement\n aka \nsqlite3_stmt\n\n\nSQLite bindings, \nsqlite3_bind_text\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n\n\nREDISQL.DELETE_STATEMENT\n\n\nREDISQL.UPDATE_STATEMENT\n\n\nRedis Blocking Command\n\n\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n\n\nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT[.NOW] db_key stmt_identifier [binding_parameters ...]\n\n\nThis command binds all the parameters to the statement created using \nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\n and identified by \nstmt_identifier\n.

Using \n?0\n is an error.\n\n\nRedis works using a text protocol, all the arguments are encoded as text, hence the module is forced to use the procedure \nsqlite3_bind_text\n, however, SQLite is smart enough to recognize numbers and treat them correctly. Numbers will be treated as numbers and text will be treated as text.\n\n\nFinally, once completed the binding part the statement is executed and its result is returned to the client.\n\n\nThis command

Internally it transform the string into a  sqlite statement  using  sqlite3_prepare_v2 , execute it against the database,  sqlite3_step , and finally returns the results to the client.  The compilation of the string into a statement and its execution happens in a different thread from the one used by Redis and so this command has a minimum impact on the overall Redis performance, however, it does block the client.  This command is quite useful to execute  PRAGMA Statements , for normal operations against the database is suggested to use  STATEMENTS .  Also, remember that there is only a single thread for database, execution of multiple  REDISQL.EXEC  against the same database will result in a serialization of the executions, one will be executed before the others.  If you only need to query the database without modifying the data is a better idea to use  REDISQL.QUERY .  Complexity : It depends entirely on the statement string. The use of a single thread for database is been chosen after several tests where the single thread configuration was faster than a multi-thread one. This is true in a write-intensive application and in a mixed write/read application.

The query must be a read-only one, exactly as  REDISQL.QUERY .  The command executes  XADD  to the stream, hence if the stream does not exists a new one is created. On the other hand, if the stream already exists the rows are simply appended.  The command itself is eager, hence it compute the whole result, append it into the stream, and then it returns. Once the command returns, the whole result set is already in the Redis stream.  The return value of the command depends on the result of the query:   If the result of the query is empty, it simply returns  [\"DONE\", 0] , exactly like  REDISQL.QUERY .  If at least one row is returnend by the query the command returns the name of the stream where it appended the resulting rows, which is exactly the one passed as input, the first and the last ID added to the stream and the total number of entries added to the stream.   The stream will use autogeneratated IDs.  Each entry in a stream is a set of field-value (key-value) pairs. The field (key) will be the type of the row and its name separated by a colon.

The stream is not deleted by RediSQL, hence it can definitely be used for caching, on the other hand too many streams will use memory.  The stream use a standard Redis key, in a cluster environment you should be sure that the database that is executing the query and the stream that will accomodate the result are on the same cluster node. \nThis can be accomplished easily by forcing the stream name to hash to the same cluster node of the database, it is sufficiento to use a  stream_name  composed as such  {db_key}:what:ever:here . Redis will hash only the part between the  {  and  }  in order to compute the cluster node.  The result can be consumed using the standard  Redis streams commands , two good starting points are  XREAD  and  XRANGE .   Complexity : The complexity of the command is  O(n)  where  n  is the amount of row returned by the query.

Using this command you can insert parameters using the special symbol  ?NNN , those parameters will be bind to the statements when you are executing the statement itself.  For now only the  ?NNN  syntax is supported, where  N  is a digit (Ex.  ?1 ,  ?2 ,  ?3  ...)  This command does not execute anything against the database, but simply store the sqlite statements into a dictionary associated with the identifier provided ( stmt_identifier ). Then it stores the information regarding the statement in the metadata table in order to provide a simple way to restore also the statements.  The statement is associated with a database, a statement created for one database cannot be used for another database, you need to create a different one. This allows a simple and fast way to provide persistence.  You can execute the statement with  REDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT .  You cannot overwrite a statement using this command.  If you need to change the implementation of a statement you have two options:   Delete the statement using  REDISQL.DELETE_STATEMENT  and the create a new one.  Use  REDISQL.UPDATE_STATEMENT   Suppose that a service needs a particular statement to be defined in order to work, this safety measure allows the users to simply go ahead, try to create it, and in case catch the error.  Also, this command is not blocking, meaning that all the work happens in a separate thread respect the redis one.  Please keep in mind that the parameters should be named in order and that there should not be any gap.  INSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3); -- this one is fine and we work as you expect\n\nINSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?123, ?564); -- this one will be more problematic, and you should avoid it  Keep in mind that SQLite start to count the bounding parameters from 1 and not from 0, using  ?0  is an error.  Complexity : If we assume that the time necessary to compile a string into a sqlite statement is constant, overall the complexity is O(1), again constant, not necessarily  fast .

Then the module executes the statement against the database associated to  db_key .  For each parameter in the query of the form  ?nnn  the engine will look for the  nnn-th  binding_parameters.\nSo if the statements is from the following query:  INSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3);  You will only need to provide 3 parameters and they will be bound, in order to  ?1 ,  ?2  and  ?3 .  If your statements looks like this:  INSERT INTO foo VALUES(?1, ?123, ?564);  You will need to provide 564 parameters and only the first, the 123-rd and the 564-th will be considered.  SQLite starts to count the binding parameters from 0, not from 1. Using  ?0  is an error.  Redis works using a text protocol, all the arguments are encoded as text, hence the module is forced to use the procedure  sqlite3_bind_text , however, SQLite is smart enough to recognize numbers and treat them correctly. Numbers will be treated as numbers and text will be treated as text.  Finally, once completed the binding part the statement is executed and its result is returned to the client.  This command as well is not blocking, all the work happens in a different thread from the one of Redis.  If you need to query your database, without modifying the data is a better idea to use  REDISQL.QUERY_STATEMENT .  Complexity : The complexity to retrieve and to bind the parameters is roughly constant for any practical purpose, however, the overall complexity will be dominated by the time to execute the query.

During the years of work with RediSQL, very few people tryied to submit valuable Pull Request, and I don't really think that this would change with zeeSQL.  Another disadvantage of a closed source project is that it won't be possible for your organization to run the project indipendently.  This is not a problem, as long as RedBeardLab is around and keep working on zeeSQL, but it could be a real problem in the next 5 or 10 years.  To avoid this problem, we pledge to release the source code of zeeSQL as soon as we are unable to support it anymore.",

Returning the result must be done in the main Redis thread. \nHence a long result can take a lot of time to be returned to the client and in that time Redis cannot serve other requests.\nWriting the result into a stream make it much more efficient use of the main Redis thread time.\n\n\nMoreover, on the other side of the network, a small consumer might not expect a big result and could be overlwhelmed by the size.\n\n\nIn standard databases this problem is usually solved using cursors, however Redis itself does not provide this facility.\nRedis provide lists, but they are simply flat list and can store only strings, it would be complex to create the cursors on top of them.\n\n\nThe streams however are a better fit. While also them can store only strings, they store them into entries, which are small key-values objects.\nEach entry represent a row of our result set.\nWhere we encode the column name and type into the key, and we use the value field to store the actual value of the column.\n\n\nAn example will be easier to follow.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nAn example of \nREDISQL.QUERY.INTO\n is the following:\n\n\nREDISQL.QUERY.INTO result_stream DB \"SELECT foo, bar FROM baz WHERE n > 42\"\n\n\n\n\nThe command will execute the query \nSELECT foo, bar FROM baz WHERE n > 42\n agains the database \nDB\n and it will \nXADD\n each row of the result to the stream \nresult_stream\n.\n\n\nIf the result is empty, the command will return \n[\"DONE\", 0]\n to the Redis client.\n\n\nIf the result is not empty, the command will return, to the Redis client, the name of the stream used (hence \nresult_stream\n in this example) along with the first ID added and the last ID added and the size of the cursor (the number of entries added to the stream.)\n\n\nIn the following example we start by creating a database, then we create a new table \nfoo\n in the database, and we store 4 rows into the table.\n\n\nThen we use the new \nREDISQL.QUERY.NOW\n command to store the result of the query \nSELECT * FROM foo\n agains the database \nDB\n in the stream \n{DB}:all_foo\n.\n\n\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.CREATE_DB DB\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB \"CREATE TABLE foo(a int, b int);\"\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 0\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB \"INSERT INTO foo(a) VALUES(1)\"\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 1\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB \"INSERT INTO foo VALUES(3, 4)\"\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 1\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB \"INSERT INTO foo VALUES(5, 6)\"\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 1\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB \"INSERT INTO foo VALUES(10, 19)\"\n1) DONE\n2) (integer) 1\n127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.QUERY.INTO {DB}:all_foo DB \"SELECT * FROM foo\"\n1) 1) \"{DB}:all_foo\"\n   2) \"1549811093979-0\"\n   3) \"1549811093979-3\"\n   4) (integer) 4\n127.0.0.1:6379> XRANGE {DB}:all_foo - +\n1) 1) \"1549811093979-0\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"1\"\n      3) \"null:b\"\n      4) \"(null)\"\n2) 1) \"1549811093979-1\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"3\"\n      3) \"int:b\"\n      4) \"4\"\n3) 1) \"1549811093979-2\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"5\"\n      3) \"int:b\"\n      4) \"6\"\n4) 1) \"1549811093979-3\"\n   2) 1) \"int:a\"\n      2) \"10\"\n      3) \"int:b\"\n      4) \"19\"\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that the stream entity contains both the type of the column and it's name as well. The format is \n$column_type:$column_name\n. This is necessary because stream support only strings.\n\n\nIn the example above the string \nint:a\n means that, for this row, the column \na\n is of type \nint\n. Usually the type of a column is constant, however, it may be null, in that case it would be something like: \nnull:b\n.\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to notice is the name of the stream used which can look peculiar. Indeed it is the same name of the database \nDB\n, between curly braces \n{DB}\n and then a useful identifier \n{DB}:all_foo\n. The name of the stream can be any name, so is not important to use this schema, however this schema is useful if you use redis cluster.\n\n\nIndeed, both keys, the target stream \n{DB}:all_foo\n and the source database \nDB\n, need to be on the same redis cluster node. Since redis use the part of the key between curly bracket to decide in which node a key should resize, this schema allow us to make sure that this invariant is always respected.\n\n\nMoreover this schema is also quite nice, allowing with a glance to know what stream refer to what database. But again, it is not necessary at all.",

Also note that is pointless to provide a type to the columns since Redis does store only strings inside the hashes, hence you will get only strings from the virtual table as well.

And so on and so forth.\n\n\nJSON or Tables\n\n\nIf your events are quite static and you already know what you are going to store the best approach is to use tables.\n\n\nAn idea could be to use this representation for the table \nEvents\n:\n\n\n| event_id | user_id | ip_address | timestamp |\n|----------|---------|------------|-----------|\n\n\n\n\nAnd then different tables for each type of events, like:\n\n\nSales\n:\n\n\n| event_id | amount  | shipping_cost | total_elements_sold |\n|----------|---------|---------------|---------------------|\n\n\n\n\nSubmits\n:\n\n\n| event_id | url_page | A/B_version |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nevent_id\n is a Primary key to the table \nEvents\n and a Foreign key on the table \nSales\n and \nSubmits\n.\n\n\nThis approach works really well, the shape of your data will be always known and it will be fast, however, you actually need to know what you are saving in your DB and change the structure of the table is quite complex.\n\n\nA different approach will be to store directly JSON in your table.\n\n\nThe new schema will be only a single table, \nEvents\n:\n\n\n| event_id | user_id | ip_address | timestamp | data |\n|----------|---------|------------|-----------|------|\n\n\n\n\nThe column data will be of type \ntext\n and it will store anything you want if encoded in JSON.\n\n\nOf course, it is also possible to run any kind of computation on the JSON data including filters and selection.\n\n\nUsing JSON you gain a lot of flexibility but you are not sure anymore of the shape of your data and if you are not careful it may cause some headaches.\n\n\nSolution Sketch\n\n\nIn this section we are going to get through a possible implementation of the above solution, we are going to use the JSON variant since I believe that not everybody knew that SQLite could handle JSON so well.\n\n\nI am assuming you already know how to get a Redis instance and how to load a module into it, if not make sure to check out \nthe readme of the project\n\n\nWe are going to automate as much as possible in this tutorial, in this way your analytic script will just run.\n\n\nThe very first thing to do is to get a working connection to your Redis instance, any Redis binding should make this process quite simple, here an example in python.\n\n\nimport redis\nr = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have established a connection the next step is to create a RediSQL database, RediSQL can manage multiple, completely independent databases, each associated with a Redis key, for this simple example we are going to use only one database that, with a lot of fantasy, \nDB\n.\n\n\nok = r.execute_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", \"DB\")\nassert ok == \"OK\"\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have created our database we can go ahead and create the table that will contain our data.

I am assuming you already know how to get a Redis instance and how to load a module into it, if not make sure to check out  the readme of the project  We are going to automate as much as possible in this tutorial, in this way your analytic script will just run.  The very first thing to do is to get a working connection to your Redis instance, any Redis binding should make this process quite simple, here an example in python.  import redis\nr = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)  Now that you have established a connection the next step is to create a RediSQL database, RediSQL can manage multiple, completely independent databases, each associated with a Redis key, for this simple example we are going to use only one database that, with a lot of fantasy,  DB .  ok = r.execute_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", \"DB\")\nassert ok == \"OK\"  Now that we have created our database we can go ahead and create the table that will contain our data. We are going to create the table if and only if it does not exists yet.  done = r.execute_command(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", \"DB\", \n                         \"\"\"CREATE TABLE\n                            IF NOT EXISTS \n                            Events(\n                                event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n                                user_id STRING,\n                                ip_address STRING,\n                                timestamp STRING,\n                                data JSON\n                            );\"\"\")\nassert done == [\"DONE\", 0]  Setting the type of  event_id  as  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  is synonymous with  ROWID  which is an autoincrement fields that do not need to be set during insert.  At this point, the only thing left to do is to listen for events in your code and write them into the database.  The simplest, and insecure, way to write the data is to use the  EXEC  function like so:  # import datetime\nuser_id = \"user_1234\"\nip_address = \"a.simple.ip.address\"\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\ndata = {\"type\" : \"sales\", \"total\": 1999, \"shipping_address\" : \"...\"}\nstatement = \"\"\"INSERT INTO Events (user_id, ip_address, timestamp, data) \n               VALUES(\\\"{}\\\", \\\"{}\\\", \\\"{}\\\", \\\"{}\\\")\"\"\" \\\n               .format(user_id, ip_address, now, data)\ndone = r.execute_command(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", \"DB\", statement)\nassert done == [\"DONE\", 1]  As you may have guessed already the return value of  REDISQL.EXEC  is a list of two elements, the string  DONE  and the integer representing the number of rows modified (inserted, deleted or updated).

He needed to insert a lot of data ~100kB in each row. And to do it fast.\n\n\nFirst tests were not so good, showing just 2000 insertions per second.

Instead of using a pointer to a piece of memory I will just copy everything I need and pass it around functions.\n\n\nSince the product was new, it made sense for us to get as low complexity as possible in such a way that it is possible to move faster understanding what our clients need and what we want to build.\n\n\nUntil now.\n\n\nThe problem\n\n\nThe biggest problem we identified was that we were copying all the input parameter, so when a client was sending as a request like \nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT DB insert 1 2 3\n we were copying 6 (insert) + 3 (1, 2, 3) = 9 bytes of memory.\n\n\n(Redis string are a little particular since they don't have a null '\\0' terminator and carry along their size.)\n\n\nNobody will complain about copying just ~10 bytes of memory, especially using slab allocator it is still some work but it is quite fast to do.\n\n\nHowever, when we start to ingest 100k bytes this will really impact negatively the performance.\n\n\nNeed for Speed\n\n\nWe could get away with just copying and freeing few bytes, especially using jemalloc, however as soon as the payload start increasing in size copying it every time started to impact negatively the performance of the module.\n\n\nWas time to buy some performances paying our share price in complexity.\n\n\nThe process was a little complex because the data lived outside the Rust code, inside Redis itself.\nIt was necessary to use \nunsafe\n code that in normal Rust you can avoid, but finally, we were able to see the Redis string as a slice (array) of chars and get a reference to it to pass around.\n\n\nResult\n\n\nBefore to release the code I obviously tested it. I used a c4.8xlarge from AWS.\n\n\nThat machine before the patch could ingest 4000 request / second each of ~100k bytes. After the patch, it was able to get 8000 requests/second.\n\n\nFinally, the latency was pretty much the same with the 99.9 percentile at ~50 milliseconds.\n\n\nXin, the gentleman who brought the issues to our attention, went even further setting several parameters available in \nredis-benchmark\n, notably the number of pipelined requests, and he reached 17000 requests per second.\n\n\nBeing conservative we can claim that our works made redisql twice (from 4000 req/s to 8000 req/s) as fast at ingesting big amount of data.\n\n\nIt is definitely necessary more testing to see the impact on different workloads, smaller payload. Fortunately, our preliminary results seem quite good.\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\nWe showed how was possible to get a lot of performance out of Rust and RediSQL switching to a zero copy approach.\n\n\nWe also showed that our solution is very efficient, being able to ingest 800 MB / s of data without any sort of tuning.\n\n\nLooking for beta tester\n\n\nWe are looking also for tester for the PRO version of RediSQL, if you would like to test the PRO module without paying anything this is your occasion.\nYou can either open an issues on github or write me (siscia) directly (email on github).",

Since the product was new, it made sense for us to get as low complexity as possible in such a way that it is possible to move faster understanding what our clients need and what we want to build.

(Redis string are a little particular since they don't have a null '\\0' terminator and carry along their size.)  Nobody will complain about copying just ~10 bytes of memory, especially using slab allocator it is still some work but it is quite fast to do.

Xin, the gentleman who brought the issues to our attention, went even further setting several parameters available in  redis-benchmark , notably the number of pipelined requests, and he reached 17000 requests per second.  Being conservative we can claim that our works made redisql twice (from 4000 req/s to 8000 req/s) as fast at ingesting big amount of data.

If the key \nHN\n already exists the call will return an error.\n\n\nThe next step is to create the structure to hold our data. In our case we will stick to something simple, a single table where we store the identifier of each item (comment or story) from HN, the author of such item, when the item was created and finally we will store the whole item as json structure in a text field.\n\n\nquery = \"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hn(id integer primary key, author text, time int, item text);\"\"\"\nawait redis.execute(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", \"HN\", query) \n\n\n\n\nFinally, since we storing data from the open internet inside our database, is wise to create an SQL statement to execute when doing an insert.\nThe advantage of the statement is that is safe from SQL injections and is usually faster than re-compile the same query each time.\n\n\nTo create a statement we can proceed as following:\n\n\nstatement = \"INSERT INTO hn VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3, json(?4));\"\nawait redis.execute(\"REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\", \"HN\", \"insert_item\", statement)\n\n\n\n\nThe last command create a new statement in the \nHN\n database and associate it with the string \ninsert_item\n so that we can refer to it later.\n\n\nAlso note the use of the \njson(?4)\n function, this is a function provided by the \nJSON1 module\n of SQLite and exposed by RediSQL that allow fast and efficient manipulation of json object. \nUsing the JSON1 module is possible to have a lot of flexibility even inside a rigid SQL schema.\n\n\nIs usually wise to wrap those command into a \ntry: except:\n block. Hence the final function will look like this:\n\n\nasync def set_up(redis):\n    try:\n        await redis.execute(\"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", \"HN\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n\n    query = \"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hn(id integer primary key, author text, time int, item text);\"\"\"\n    try:\n        await redis.execute(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", \"HN\", query)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n\n    statement = \"INSERT INTO hn VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3, json(?4));\"\n    try:\n        await redis.execute(\"REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\", \"HN\", \"insert_item\", statement)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\n\n\nRunning the loop\n\n\nNow that we have set up our environment we can go on and start to listen for new items posted on HN.\n\n\nThe API provides a simple endpoint \nmaxitem.json\n that returns the id of the latest item posted on HN.\nWhen the loop start we get maxitem and we store it into Redis. \nThen, when the maxitem get updated we download each of the items between the \nold maxitem\n and the \nnew maxitem\n. \n\n\nWe repeat the loop forever with a sleep to avoid hammering the API endpoint.\n\n\nasync def main(redis, http):\n    max_item = await get_max_item(http)\n    await redis.execute(\"SET\", \"max-item\", max_item)\n    old_max_item = max_item\n    while True:\n        # we download the new maxitem\n        max_item = await get_max_item(http)\n        # if the new maxitem is actually bigger than the old one\n        if max_item > old_max_item:\n            # for each new item...\n            for i in range(old_max_item, max_item):\n                # we start a new Task that store the item in our database\n                store = store_item(http, redis, str(i))\n                asyncio.ensure_future(store)\n            await redis.execute(\"SET\", \"max-item\", max_item)\n            old_max_item = max_item\n        asyncio.sleep(1)\n\n\n\n\nStoring the data into RediSQL\n\n\nThe last interesting bit is about the \nstore_item\n function that is the one that download the item from the API and store it into RediSQL.\n\n\nasync def store_item(http, redis, item_id):\n    item = await get_hn_item(http, item_id)\n    await store_on_db(redis, item)\n\nasync def get_hn_item(http, item_id):\n    while True:\n        async with http.get(get_item_url(item_id)) as item:\n            if 200 <= item.status < 300:\n                data = await item.text()\n                item = json.loads(data)\n                if item:\n                    return item\n\n# In this function we store the item into the RediSQL database\nasync def store_on_db(redis, item):\n    try:\n        # execute the statement passing the necessary parameters\n        await redis.execute(\"REDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\", \"HN\", \"insert_item\", \n                item[\"id\"], item.get(\"by\", \"_no_author_\"), item[\"time\"], json.dumps(item))\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n        print(item[\"id\"])\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the item from the API is a simple HTTP GET request, then we simply check if it returns a successful status code and that it actually returns valid json.\n\n\nFinally to store the element into RediSQL we execute the statement that we have create before during the set up phase.\nIndeed we are executing the command \nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT HN insert_item $item_id $item_author $item_time $item\n.\nThis command will find inside the database \nHN\n the statement \ninsert_item\n that we have previously defined as \nINSERT INTO hn VALUES(?1, ?2, ?3, json(?4));\n.\nNow the item id will be substituted to \n?1\n, the item author will substitute \n?2\n, the creation time of the item will take the place of \n?3\n and the whole json string of the item will substitute \n?4\n, finally the statement is executed agains RediSQL and its result returned.\n\n\nIf everything went right, we have just added our first row to the database using async python.\n\n\nConcluding\n\n\nIn this tutorial we took a rather simple problem and we use it to show how to use RediSQL with async python.\n\n\nWe started by setting up the database, we show how to create a database and tables inside it. Then we also show how to create statements to avoid SQL injections attack and improve the efficiency of repeated queries.\n\n\nThen we obtain the data from the Hacker News API and we show how to insert the data into RediSQL using the statement that we have just created.\n\n\nHopefully this tutorial will be helpful and sufficient to get started, but if you have any question feel free to get in touch or to open an issue.\n\n\nIf you wish to see a similar tutorial for a different language, \nopen an issue on github.",

Then it is possible to use that pool as a client and have the library allocate a client for us.\n\n\nredis, err := radix.NewPool(\"tcp\", \"localhost:6379\", 10)\nif err != nil {\n    fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n}\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the database\n\n\nIn order to work with RediSQL is necessary to do a small setup. \nThe first step is always to create a database, then we create the tables inside the databases and finally the different statements if they are necessary.\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to use statements instead of building query by hand, but it is not mandatory. \nThe use of statements eliminate the risk of SQL injection and it is more performant, since the query is parsed only once and not every time it get executed.\n\n\nIn our case we create a simple database that we will call \nHN\n.\n\n\nr.Do(radix.Cmd(nil, \"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", \"HN\"))\n\n\n\n\nThen we create a single table \nhn\n inside the \nHN\n database.\n\n\ntable := \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hn(id integer primary key, author text, time int, item text);\"\nr.Do(radix.Cmd(nil, \"REDISQL.EXEC\", \"HN\", table))\n\n\n\n\nThe table will contains the \nid\n of each item we are getting from HN, along with the author of the item, when the item was posted and finally the last field will contains the whole item as a \njson\n string.\n\n\nThe last step is to create a statement to easily insert the data inside our table.\n\n\nstmt := `INSERT INTO hn VALUES(\n    json_extract(json(?1),'$.id'), \n    json_extract(json(?1),'$.by'), \n    json_extract(json(?1),'$.time'), \n    json(?1));`\nr.Do(radix.Cmd(nil, \"REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\", \"HN\", \"insert_item\", stmt))\n\n\n\n\nThe statement is a little complex. \nIt exploit the \nJSON1\n sqlite extension to extract the necessary fields from a JSON string. \nIn particular we extract the \nid\n, the \nby\n (author) and the \ntime\n fields.\n\n\nAfter that those fields are extracted from the JSON string we store all of them into the database along with the whole item.\n\n\nThe loop\n\n\nAfter the database is ready to accept data, we start to poll the HN API in order to fetch the newest item. \nEach item is then pushed into the \nitemIds\n channel that is later consumed.\n\n\nitemIds := make(chan int, 10)\n\ngo func() {\n    oldMaxItemId := getMaxItem()\n    for {\n        newMaxItemId := getMaxItem()\n        for ; oldMaxItemId < newMaxItemId; oldMaxItemId++ {\n            itemIds <- oldMaxItemId\n        }\n        time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)\n    }\n}()\n\n\n\n\nThe API provide an endpoint that show the biggest element in HN at the moment, it is a simple auto-incremental id that we can fetch using the \ngetMaxItem()\n function implemented as:\n\n\nfunc getMaxItem() int {\n    resp, _ := http.Get(\"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json\")\n    defer resp.Body.Close()\n    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n    n, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(body))\n    return n\n}\n\n\n\n\nFinally the main loop iterate through the \nitemIds\n channel.\nFor each new item we use again the HN API to get the content of the items and then we store it into RediSQL.\n\n\nfor itemId := range itemIds {\n    go func() {\n        item := getItem(itemId)\n        err := redis.Do(radix.Cmd(nil, \"REDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\", \"HN\", \"insert_item\", item))\n        if err != nil {\n            fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n    }()\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngetitem()\n functions implement a trivial error recovery strategy. \nIndeed, after some trial and error, was clear that, sometimes, the element \nn\n is not ready yet even if the element \nn+1\n was published as \nmaxitem\n and the API returns the simple string \"null\", if that is the case we simply repeat the call.\n\n\nfunc getItem(id int) string {\n    for {\n        url := fmt.Sprintf(\"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/%d.json\", id)\n        resp, _ := http.Get(url)\n        defer resp.Body.Close()\n        body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n        result := string(body)\n        if result != \"null\" {\n            return result\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConcluding\n\n\nThis small example (less than 80 lines) show how simple is to quickly get value from RediSQL.\nIndeed is sufficient to set up the database following always the same steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate the database with \nREDISQL.CREATE_DB $db_name\n\n\nCreate the schema inside your database \nREDISQL.EXEC $db_name \"CREATE TABLE ... etc\"\n and, if you want, the statements: \nREDISSQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $statement_name \"INSERT INTO ... etc\"\n\n\nStart inserting data, with or without a statement: \nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n or simply \nREDISQL.EXEC\n\n\n\n\nFinally to query back the data is possible to use:\n\n\n\n\nqueries \nREDISQL.QUERY $db_name \"SELECT * FROM ...\"\n,\n\n\nstatements \nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $query_name \"SELECT * FROM ... WHERE foo = ?1\"\n and the \nREDISQL.QUERY_STATEMENTS $db_name $query_name \"paramenters\"\n\n\nsimple exec \nREDISQL.EXEC $db_name \"SELECT * FROM ... etc\"\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to explore our \nreferences documentation\n to understand better what capabilities RediSQL provides you.\n\n\nThe complete code of this example is \navailable here.\n\n\nIf you wish to see a similar tutorial for a different language, \nopen an issue on github.",

We need to:\n\n\n\n\nCreate our database in RediSQL using the \nREDISQL.CREATE_DB\n command.\n\n\nCreate the table that will contains our data using the \nREDISQL.EXEC\n command.\n\n\nCreate the statement to actually insert the data into the database using the \nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\n command. \n\n\n\n\nWe will store in our table the \nid\n of the item we are adding, the author of the item, when the item was posted on HN and finally the whole item as a JSON structure.\n\n\nThe third step is not strictly needed, but it provide defense against SQL-injections, is more performant, and it is just a cleaner way to do it. \nThe alternative would be to just use \nREDISQL.EXEC\n every time we want to add a new row to the database.\n\n\nAll those steps are done in the \nsetUp\n functions.\n\n\nconst setUp = async () => {\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", [\"HN\"]).catch( err => console.log(err) );\n        table = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hn(id integer primary key, author text, time int, item text);\"\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", ['HN', table]).catch( err => console.log(err) );\n        stmt = \"INSERT INTO hn VALUES(\" + \n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.id'),\" +\n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.by'),\" +\n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.time'),\" +\n        \"json(?1));\";\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\", ['HN', 'insert_item', stmt])\n                .catch( err => console.log(err) );\n};\n\n\n\n\nNote how nicely the \nJSON1\n modules help us. \nIt extracts for us the \nid\n of the item we want to add, the author of the item (the \nby\n field) and the time when the item was created.\nWithout it we would be force to do that operation ourselves and pass more parameters to the statement.\n\n\nInsert data into the database\n\n\nFinally let's make a simple function that will gets an item from HN and stores it into our database executing the statement we just created.\n\n\nconst storeItem = async id => {\n        let item = await getItem(id);\n        console.log(item);\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\", ['HN', 'insert_item', JSON.stringify(item)])\n                .catch( err => console.log(err) );\n}\n\n\n\n\nRunning it\n\n\nNow that we have all our piece in order we can just combine them together.\n\n\nWe will start by creating the database, table and statements.\n\n\nThen a simple infinite loop will simply keep pooling the API.\nAs soon as it detects new items available, it download them, and store those into the database.\n\n\nWe also include a small throttling mechanism to avoid hammering the API, which is not needed using the \nsleep\n function.\n\n\nconst sleep = (waitTimeInMs) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTimeInMs));\n\n(async () => {\n        setUp();\n        let maxItem = await getMaxItem();\n        while (true) {\n                let newMaxItem = await getMaxItem();\n                for (; maxItem < newMaxItem; maxItem += 1) {\n                        storeItem(maxItem);\n                }\n                await sleep(5 * 1000);\n        }\n})()\n\n\n\n\nConcluding\n\n\nIn this small example (less than 60 lines) we show how simple and easy is to get started with RediSQL. We just set up the database and table once, along with the statement and that's it.\nA much quicker set up, especially for testing, than using classical databases as \nPostgres\n or \nMySQL\n.\n\n\nIndeed is sufficient to set up the database following always the same steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate the database with \nREDISQL.CREATE_DB $db_name\n\n\nCreate the schema inside your database \nREDISQL.EXEC $db_name \"CREATE TABLE ... etc\"\n and, if you want, the statements: \nREDISSQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $statement_name \"INSERT INTO ... etc\"\n\n\nStart inserting data, with or without a statement: \nREDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT\n or simply \nREDISQL.EXEC\n\n\n\n\nFinally to query back the data is possible to use:\n\n\n\n\nqueries \nREDISQL.QUERY $db_name \"SELECT * FROM ...\"\n,\n\n\nstatements \nREDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $query_name \"SELECT * FROM ...

Create the table that will contains our data using the  REDISQL.EXEC  command.  Create the statement to actually insert the data into the database using the  REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT  command.    We will store in our table the  id  of the item we are adding, the author of the item, when the item was posted on HN and finally the whole item as a JSON structure.  The third step is not strictly needed, but it provide defense against SQL-injections, is more performant, and it is just a cleaner way to do it. \nThe alternative would be to just use  REDISQL.EXEC  every time we want to add a new row to the database.  All those steps are done in the  setUp  functions.  const setUp = async () => {\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_DB\", [\"HN\"]).catch( err => console.log(err) );\n        table = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hn(id integer primary key, author text, time int, item text);\"\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.EXEC\", ['HN', table]).catch( err => console.log(err) );\n        stmt = \"INSERT INTO hn VALUES(\" + \n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.id'),\" +\n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.by'),\" +\n        \"json_extract(json(?1),'$.time'),\" +\n        \"json(?1));\";\n        await send_command(\"REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT\", ['HN', 'insert_item', stmt])\n                .catch( err => console.log(err) );\n};  Note how nicely the  JSON1  modules help us. \nIt extracts for us the  id  of the item we want to add, the author of the item (the  by  field) and the time when the item was created.\nWithout it we would be force to do that operation ourselves and pass more parameters to the statement.",

            "text": "In this small example (less than 60 lines) we show how simple and easy is to get started with RediSQL. We just set up the database and table once, along with the statement and that's it.\nA much quicker set up, especially for testing, than using classical databases as  Postgres  or  MySQL .  Indeed is sufficient to set up the database following always the same steps:   Create the database with  REDISQL.CREATE_DB $db_name  Create the schema inside your database  REDISQL.EXEC $db_name \"CREATE TABLE ... etc\"  and, if you want, the statements:  REDISSQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $statement_name \"INSERT INTO ... etc\"  Start inserting data, with or without a statement:  REDISQL.EXEC_STATEMENT  or simply  REDISQL.EXEC   Finally to query back the data is possible to use:   queries  REDISQL.QUERY $db_name \"SELECT * FROM ...\" ,  statements  REDISQL.CREATE_STATEMENT $db_name $query_name \"SELECT * FROM ... WHERE foo = ?1\"  and the  REDISQL.QUERY_STATEMENTS $db_name $query_name \"paramenters\"  simple exec  REDISQL.EXEC $db_name \"SELECT * FROM ... etc\"   Feel free to explore our  references documentation  to understand better what capabilities RediSQL provides you.  The complete code of this example is  available here.  If you wish to see a similar tutorial for a different language,  open an issue on github.",
